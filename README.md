# HTML 5 form attribute polyfill #

Polyfill for form attribute which is not supported by MS IE and Edge < 16. This script first
 tests if the form attribute is not anyway supported and then polls to detect new forms.
The polyfill is then applied to the newly detected forms.

This script was only shortly tested with Internet Explorer 11. Therefore, it should be
tested again before it's used in production.
